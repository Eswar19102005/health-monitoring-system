# About
Hi there! We are  BLADEK MEMBERS, a web developer team with over a decade of experience. This course, "HTML CSS JavaScript Projects," was created to share our knowledge and experience with you. In this course, you'll learn how to build simple, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this course, you'll learn how to install Visual Studio Code and its extensions, and then we'll start from scratch with each project. After finishing HTML, we'll move on to CSS and JavaScript. Building in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is fine, and this guide will explain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.

Each project in this course is started from scratch and finished without using copied code. Then, we'll go over the code together to ensure that everyone understands. This program's exciting project-based curriculum includes building modern, super cool, and responsive websites.
